    "### Context\n",
    "My main motivation for further researching the `re` module (Python's regex module), and writing about it, was that I have often relied on using RegEx in my code, but outside of very simple expressions, I was never comfortable using it in enterprise level code (code that is shared by my team and deployed for our customers). I have relied on Stack Overflow for very simple regular expressions but nothing beyond because I didn't fully understand the more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "And despite how well written some of the Stackoverflow posts are, there were many doubts in my mind. For example I vividly remember seeing `(?:...)` in some answers, but not appreciating why the author put `?:` inside the parentheses. I tried doing an AB test (with and without the `?:`), and I couldn't deciper the effect this syntax has. Now that I have read much more about RegEx and tried it out, I know this construct is called a 'non-capturing group'. I will unpack this and other features of `re` in this article, which, I think, if you understand, will make you an intermediate user of RegEx.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you another spoiler (which will create more context for this article), the core building block on which intermediate usage of regex is built, is Grouping. And that's the core learning I'm trying to share in this article. Many powerful regex features, mentioned here and otherwise, build on top of Grouping, so it will serve you well to understand Grouping well."

    "#### 1. Raw Strings\n",
    "In Python, we usually create RegEx strings using 'raw strings'. A Python raw string is created by prefixing a string literal with 'r' or 'R', like so: `r\"Hello world\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between regular strings and raw strings is that raw strings treat the backslash(`\\`) as a literal character. However, in regular Python strings, backslashes are used to indicate escape sequences like `\\n`, `\\r` or `\\t`. In other words, the raw string `r\"\\n\"` is two characters `\\` and `n`, but the regular string `\"\\n\"` is one character, namely `\\n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we want to create a string that contains backslash(`\\`) and donâ€™t want it to be treated as an escape character, we use raw strings."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "__Why is this relevant in regex__<br>\n",
    "It's recommended that you use raw strings to create RegEx patterns, because the RegEx engine interprets backslashes in a special way. For example, when you put `\\d` in a regex pattern, it indicates (to the RegEx engine) a digit between 0 to 9. But the Python interpreter interprets backslashes in strings in a different, non-literal, way as well, which creates a conflict when using backslashes in regular strings in Python. In fact, `\\d` is an invalid escape sequence according to the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if you use `\\d` in a regular Python string, the Python interpreter will think you're trying to create an escape sequence and you'll get a Syntax Warning that `\\d` is an invalid escape sequence, because it doesn't mean anything to Python. Plus, I believe that in future versions, you'll get a syntax error for the same, so it will make even more sense to use raw strings to create such RegEx strings."
