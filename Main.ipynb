    "My main motivation for further researching the `re` module (Python's regex module), and writing about it, was that I have often relied on using RegEx in my code, but outside of very simple expressions, I was never comfortable using it in enterprise level code (code that is shared by my team and deployed for our customers). I have relied on Stack Overflow for very simple regular expressions but nothing beyond because I didn't fully understand the more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "And despite how well written some of the Stackoverflow posts are, there were many doubts in my mind. For example I vividly remember seeing `(?:...)` in some answers, but not appreciating why the author put `?:` inside the parentheses. I tried doing an AB test (with and without the `?:`), and I couldn't deciper the effect this syntax has. Now that I have read much more about RegEx and tried it out, I know this construct is called a 'non-capturing group'. I will unpack this and other features of `re` in this article, which, I think, if you understand, will make you an intermediate user of RegEx.\n",

    "To give you another spoiler (which will create more context for this article), the core building block on which intermediate usage of regex is built, is Grouping.

As opposed to __Module level__ functions that re-compile the regex pattern every time you want to match it with a string. <p>_Side Note_: Actually the Module level functions automatically store compiled objects in a cache, so realistically, there isn't a big difference unless you have a lot of regex calls using different regex patterns."
